# Rock Paper Scissors Project
This project is a simple implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. The game is played entirely in the console, where the user competes against the computer. The project was developed with a problem-solving approach, and along the way, we encountered and resolved several issues while also improving the game's functionality.
